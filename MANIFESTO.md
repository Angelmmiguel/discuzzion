# Manifesto

**Privacy and freedom of expression** are the core ideas of this project. Nowadays we are data. It's difficult to find sites that don't collect any information. Almost all the Internet get information and statistics about us. What you want, what you like, who you are.

The purpose of this data is very diverse: customize ads, identify profiles for selling new products, reach an specific group of people with similar thoughts, punish people, etc. The main two problems this project wants to cover are:

* **Information isolation**: when your profile is done you can say hello to your buble. Your navegation customization affects the information and the people you can find. All recommended things that social sites or search engines provide you are precisely calculated for you. If you want to get a different point view or meet people with different opinion, you will need to open a private browser window and connect to different proxies in other countries.

* **Attacks to freedom of expression**: sometimes governments use your thoughts to punish you. Behind laws and false statements, they can point to a tweet and send prison an individual. Nobody must be sent prison by an idea.

Based on this premises, this project doesn't store **any** personal information about people. The only information this project manages is:

* A temporal random identifier for every user. When the user closes the browser tab, that information is deleted. Also, this identifier is totally random. **It's not based in any information of your computer**.

* Messages travel through the server but they aren't stored. That's the reason you don't get the message history when you enter in a room. We don't have that information. Also, end to end encryption is on the roadmap.

* The room and topics are stored in memory. If we restart the server, all the rooms and topics are lost.

In addition, this page doesn't include any page tracking like Google Analytics. You're anonymous here.
